## Computer-Science-1

This was an introductory course on data structures and the design and analysis of algorithms. We developed formal, mathematical techniques for analyzing algorithms in terms of time and space efficiency. We worked on our problemsolving skills by designing and implementing efficient solutions to problems in C. We also covered recursion, common data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, binary heaps, and hash tables),sorting techniques, and search algorithms. 

All assignements are written in the C programming language.

### Glowworm
This program is a worm that begins with a tail and head, '~' and 'G' respectively. It takes in a maximum size of worm and a string which will make it grow or shrink. More information can be found in the assignment pdf in the glowworm folder. The purpouse of the assignment is to refresh on C knowledge and work with manipulating string. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the Glowworm folder.
### KindredSpirits
This program checks two binary trees and determine if they were "kindred spirits." Essentially this was to check if the preorder traversal of the left tree is the same as the postorder traversal of the right tree. This purpose of this assignement was to learn to work with binary trees and learn how to traverse them with different methods. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the KindredSpirits folder.
### ListyString
This program takes in a string and to convert it to a linked list. After converting, we take in different commands which will manipulate the linked list according to the command description. The purpose of this assignment was to learn to create and manipulate linked list in C. It also helped gain I/O experience in C and process command line arguments. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the ListyString folder.
### LonelyPartyArray
This program keeps track of multiple different arrays which are dynamically allocated in an effort to conserve memory. This program helped gain expirience with dynamically allocating memory in C rather than allocating mememory all at once and wasting memory. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the LonelyPartyArray folder.
### SneakyRooks
This program takes in a list of coordinate strings for rooks on a chess board, and determines if any of the rooks can attack one another. The trickiest part of this assignement is that the runtime cannot exceed O(m+n) So it must be linear. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the LonelyPartyArray folder.
